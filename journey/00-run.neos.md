## Project setup

In Google Cloud, resources are organized together in the form of
projects.

<walkthrough-project-setup billing="true"></walkthrough-project-setup>

<walkthrough-enable-apis apis="storage.googleapis.com,
run.googleapis.com,
artifactregistry.googleapis.com">
</walkthrough-enable-apis>

## Deploying the sample container

1. Navigate to the Cloud Run console.

<walkthrough-menu-navigation sectionId="SERVERLESS_SECTION"></walkthrough-menu-navigation>

1. Click **Create service** on the console page.

1. Ensure the **Deploy one revision from an existing container image** option is selected.

1. Click the **Test with a sample container** button. The **Container image URL** field will be autopopulated with a Google-provided container image.

1. In the **Region** pulldown menu, select the region where you would like this service to run.

1. Under the **Authentication** section, select **Allow unauthenticated invocations**.

1. Click **Create** to deploy the service to Cloud Run using the prebuilt container image.


## Accessing the sample container

1. The **Revisions** page for the sample Cloud Run service should now be displayed. Wait for deployment to complete.

1. Once it has completed, you can access the Cloud Run service by clicking on the **URL** provided by Cloud Run.

1. Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a service to Cloud Run using a prebuilt container image.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully deployed a sample Cloud Run service using a prebuilt container image. For simplicity, this walkthrough allowed for unauthenticated invocations; this means any external user can access your container using the URL provided by Cloud Run. To learn more about authentication in Cloud Run, see this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/overview).

## Cleanup

To avoid unwanted charges, navigate back to the Cloud Run console.

<walkthrough-menu-navigation sectionId="SERVERLESS_SECTION"></walkthrough-menu-navigation>

1. Select the checkbox next to the **hello** Cloud Run service.

1. Click on the **Delete** button at the top of the Cloud Run console.

1. Confirm deletion by clicking on the **Delete** button on the card that appears.

1. Wait for deletion to complete.
